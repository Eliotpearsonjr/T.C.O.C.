===== T.C.O.C. =====

* About this project:
  My semester GUI project is a mobile game that I have developed with Unity. The game is
  named T.C.O.C (Take care of cuties) but is listen as the placeholder name 'poppin pals' on
  both the GitHub repository, as well as the Unity Editor.

* Build Information:
  This project was devloped as a mobile application for Android devices. This means that the
  project is meant to run on such devices, as it does not have native desktop support. The
  build file has been pushed to this repository with the '.apk' extension.
  
* Running this project:
  To run the project, simply install the .apk file on any Android device. To do this you will
  need to allow the device to install unknown applications within the device's settings.
  Settings > Apps > Special Access > Install Unknwown Apps > Files (or whatever app you have
  downloaded the file from).
  I run this project natively on my device and it runs smoothly
  only after having taken these necessary steps. The application might be out of date with the
  lastest version of Android OS, but may still be ran.

  If you do not have a device to run this project on, you can also run the .apk file on an
  android emulator for desktop such as Android Studio. I have not tested this method of
  running the project, so I sadly do not have steps detailing the process of opening the .apk
  file on an emulator.
